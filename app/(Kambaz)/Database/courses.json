    "description": "This course is designed to teach students advanced argumentation and public speaking skills through fierce bowl debate competitions. Competitions will last 48-84 hours and will ironically be held in a large bowl. Past debated topics include: are those cereal bowls with straws attached the greatest invention of all time? and what circumference does a bread roll need to be considered a bread bowl? Students should expect to lose 10-35 pounds by the end of the course due to the intensity of the debates and lack of food offered."

I remember complete darkness, a loud and terrifying screeching noise, and then a blinding light. Next thing I knew, a booming voice called down to me, 'You should not be here.' I woke up sweating profusely in Fair Grove, Missouri. I would strongly discourage enrolling in this class."
